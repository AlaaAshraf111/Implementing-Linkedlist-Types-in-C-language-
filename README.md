Implementation of functions that can handle linkedlist data using C language  
## What is Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

## Why linked list data structure needed?
### Dynamic Data structure: 
&emsp;The size of memory can be allocated or de-allocated at run time based on the operation insertion or deletion.
### Ease of Insertion/Deletion:
&emsp;The insertion and deletion of elements are simpler than arrays since no elements need to be shifted after insertion and deletion, Just the address needed to be updated.
### Efficient Memory Utilization:
&emsp;the size increases or decreases as per the requirement so this avoids the wastage of memory. 
### Implementation:
&emsp;Various advanced data structures can be implemented using a linked list like a stack, queue.
## Types of Linked List:
1. Single linked list
2. Double linkedlist
3. Circular linked list
   
   There are other compound types of single, double, and circular linked lists, such as Circular-Double 
   linked list and Header linked list.
